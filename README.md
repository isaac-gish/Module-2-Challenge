All code was authored by me except for the following section: 

"For i = 2 To LastRow
    'If cell above is not equal
    If ws.Cells(i - 1, 1).Value <> ws.Cells(i, 1).Value Then
        
        FirstValue = ws.Cells(i, 3).Value
    End If"

The above code was authored by ChatGPT and used to help me figure out how to find only the first value. In my original code I could not figure out how to do this one part of it so I was receiving the wrong values. 
I resorted to using ChatGPT after posting in slack and receiving no response and staying for office hours and not finding a solution.

VBA files are stored with Part 1 only, and VBA files are stored with both Part 1 and Part 2. Both of these apply to all three worksheets within the VBA file. 
VBA files were saved using VS code using the VB format.
